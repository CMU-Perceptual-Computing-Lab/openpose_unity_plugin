# OpenPose Plugin for Unity - Documentation

## Operating Systems
- **Windows** 7, 8, 10.

## Unity Software
- Unity versions higher or equal than 2018.2.9f1. Previous versions may work as well. 

## Prerequisites
- If you plan to use the default OpenPose DLL (recommended):
    - Make sure that the [latest OpenPose portable demo](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/releases) works properly by running the default examples following the [OpenPose doc/quick_start.md#quick-start](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/quick_start.md#quick-start).
- If you also plan to compile and install the OpenPose C++ library on the same machine (e.g., if you plan to use the latest GitHub version rather than the latest official release or if you intend to modify the OpenPose C++ library):
    1. [Install the OpenPose prerequisites](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation.md#prerequisites).
    2. [Install OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation.md) and make sure the `BUILD_UNITY_SUPPORT` flag is enabled in CMake-GUI.
    3. Make sure that OpenPose works properly by [running the default examples](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/quick_start.md#quick-start).
    4. Note: Only Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise Update 3, CUDA 8, and cuDNN 5.1 are officially supported and tested in order to compile the C++ OpenPose library. VS versions different to 2015 or CUDA versions different to 8 are not officially supported. They might or might not get support in the future. In order to use a different version, just make sure you can run the OpenPose examples with that software. Unity installs by default VS Community 2017. If you installed already VS 2017 and you desire to use OpenPose with VS 2015 Enterprise Update 3, you have to:
        1. Uninstall VS 2015 and 2017.
        2. Install the OpenPose prerequisites (VS 2015, CUDA 8, cuDNN 5.1). Not re-installing VS 2015 after uninstalling VS 2017 might lead to really cryptic bugs in VS 2015 when compiling OpenPose.
        3. Install OpenPose following the above steps.
    5. Install Unity without VS Community 2017 (so Unity will automatically use the same existing VS version than OpenPose uses). Tested and officially supported only for Unity versions higher or equal than 2018.2.9f1.

## Running the OpenPose Unity Demo
- Clone or download the project into your local machine.
- Go to “OpenPosePlugin/Assets/OpenPose/” folder and run "getPlugins.bat". This will automatically download and unzip OpenPose plugins.
- Go to “OpenPosePlugin/Assets/StreamingAssets/models/” folder and run "getModels.bat". This will automatically download required models for OpenPose. 
- Open Unity editor and run the "Demo.unity" in "OpenPosePlugin/Assets/OpenPose/Examples/Scenes/".
- (Optional) Read the [UML diagram](./OpenPoseUnityPlugin_UML.pdf) for more information.
